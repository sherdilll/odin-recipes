<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Banana Chocolate chip muffins are a nice, warm treat almost anytime. If you
  like to change up your morning meal now and then or take a snack with you for
  the day, this is a great way to do that. Store these muffins in an airtight
  container at room temperature for up to five days or in the freezer for up to
  three months. To avoid freezer burn, wrap each muffin in plastic wrap and
  store in a freezer bag or container. Reheat in the microwave or thaw on the
  counter at room temperature when you want one.
