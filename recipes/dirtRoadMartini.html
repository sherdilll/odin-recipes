<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Dolly Parton and Rachel Parton Geroge share their unique twist on a classic
  martini in their cookbook "Good Lookin' Cookin'." In addition to olives, the
  sisters add in iced tea and pickled vegetables.
</p>

<p>
  Olives come to mind for just about everybody when they think of a martini, but
  why stop there? We like the taste that tea and pickled vegetables give this,
  Rachel's version of the classic drink. Giardiniera is a colorful combination
  of pickled carrots, cauliflower, celery, pickles, red bell peppers, and onions
  that make this martini especially good lookin'.
